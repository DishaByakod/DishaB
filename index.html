          I started drawing mandalas during my summer holidays after 12th grade.
          When I intailly started making them it was just random designs on a piece
          of paper later I discovered that they are termed as mandalas and zentangales.

          A mandala (Sanskrit: मण्डल, romanized: maṇḍala, lit. 'circle', [ˈmɐɳɖɐlɐ]) is a geometric configuration of symbols.
          A mandala generally represents the spiritual journey, starting from outside to the inner core, through layers.

        such as networking, C programming, C++, DBMS, HTML5 and CSS3.

        I learnt stiching from my mother who learnt it from her mother
        my gardmother had done a diploma in stiching. I still a learner in it
        I have managed to design some of my own clothes and would love to improve
        myself and learn alot in stiching. I like anything that involves creativity
        and designing definatly does.
        “Fashion is the most powerful art there is. It’s a movement, design, and
        architecture all in one. It shows the world who we are and who we’d like to be.”

        Last but not the least, one of my favroite skill- Drama .
        I have always loved being dramatic in life because it makes life
        so much more entertaning. I was in 3rd grade when I watched a bollywood
        moive named "Jab we met" and I love the role of kaneena kapoor so much in it
        that I practiced every single dailog of her's and I used to act it infront of
        my sister and my sister told me how good I was at it and since then I always
        wanted to become an actress.
